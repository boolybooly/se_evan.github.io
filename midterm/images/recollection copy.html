  <p>Design: A very simple but successful design when it comes to the overall website. Its simplicity is complimented well by the graphics designed around each song.</p>
  <p>Usability: The usability of this website is fantastic. It's simple but the different interactive aspects keep things interesting and exciting from song to song.</p>
  <p>Content: The music and way the visuals accompany the music is very well done and makes for a very exciting and entertaining website that can be enjoyed for extensive amounts of time.</p>
  <p>Creativity: Creativity is where this website exceeds. The way the interactive features force you to listen and give each song a chance while also incorporating visuals based around each of their album covers is a great way to introduce and share music to people.</p>
