    <h2>Proposal</h2>

    <p>Punk originated as a fight against political, economic and social normalities, adopting characteristics of anarchy and providing a community that allowed for free expression. Although these beliefs have still remained a part of the philosophy behind punk rock, the history and image of popular punk bands have been majorly represented by groups of white men. The first examples most people think of when they hear punk are names like the ramones, the sex pistols, The clash, all white male bands. With some of these artists even participating in the discrimination that they were fighting against. The hypocrisy of these popular punk bands is what my website will be about by means of a parody website.  </p>
    <p>The website will be formatted as a band website for a fake punk band titled JoJo and The Dog Faced Rat Boys. On the surface, the website will be designed to look like a punk band website, promoting upcoming music, shows and merchandise.The style of it will be based on Punk posters and Zines with many of the punk themes will be depicted, for example anarchy (Anti-Capitalism in particular), the feeling of being discriminated against, etc… Beneath this surface, through animations and transitions, the hypocrisy throughout history will be revealed. </p>
    <p> The transitions will be incorporated into the photographs for example one might be a mouth opening or the removal of a bandaid revealing the page behind it. I want to keep the website in the fun playful nature of punk rock to emphasise the parody aspect of punk websites. </p>
    <p>It will be commenting on a few of the major contradictions made between the punk ideology and the punk industry. I will be discussing the underrepresentation based on race, gender and sexual orientation as well as discrimination by individual popular punk bands. As the purpose of this website is to educate, there will also be examples of songs, albums and movements by the underrepresented musicians, as well as information on the impact these bands had on the creation and direction of punk.</p>
    <p>I will also be pointing out the active participation in capitalism and fast fashion despite them fighting against it. This involves merchandise but most specifically the capitalization of band shirts and the environmental damages of  fast fashion which is estimated by the UN to contribute 8-10% of Carbon emissions. I will also mention the presence of financial leverage to promote punk bands and boost them to popularity.</p>
    <p>Punk as a whole has been an outlet for communities to fight against oppression. This includes bands like the sex pistols and the clash who were fighting against the mistreatment of the working class in the UK and famous movements like bikini kill and the riot grrrl movement, which fought for womens voice in the music industry. But despite these bands fighting against a form of oppression, they participated in oppression themselves. For example Johnny Rotten, the lead singer of the sex pistols, has expressed a objection of same sex parenting and aligned with “all lives matter”, the slogan opposing the black lives matter movement. The riot grrrl movement, in all its efforts to fight for the rights of women, had a history of racism towards women of colour. </p>
    <p>The true identity of punk is meant to fight against discrimination and my intention with this website is to educate about the parts of punk that havent been given the spotlight they deserve for the impact and influence they have, while at the same time making a parody of the hypocrisy of many of the punk bands we are most familiar with. </p>
